/**
 * An {@link AllocationManager} that packs small allocations into large pre-allocated chunks using a
 * bump-pointer strategy, specifically designed for Arrow column decompression in high-column-count
 * scenarios (e.g., 1000+ columns).
 *
 * <h3>Why not Netty's PooledByteBufAllocator?</h3>
 *
 * <p>Arrow column decompression produces a burst of ~3000 small, variable-sized allocations (1000
 * columns x ~3 buffers each: validity, offset, data). Netty's allocator is optimized for a
 * different pattern and causes problems here:
 *
 * <table border="1" cellpadding="4">
 *   <tr><th>Aspect</th><th>Netty PooledByteBufAllocator</th><th>ChunkedAllocationManager</th></tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Small allocation</td>
 *     <td>Routes through size-class subpages (tiny/small/normal). Different sizes land on
 *         different subpages within different pages of the <b>same or different chunks</b>,
 *         causing cross-chunk fragmentation.</td>
 *     <td>Sequential bump-pointer within the current chunk. All sizes packed contiguously into
 *         <b>one chunk</b> regardless of size class.</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Chunk selection</td>
 *     <td>Tries q050 &rarr; q025 &rarr; q000 &rarr; qInit &rarr; q075, preferring
 *         moderately-used chunks. May <b>spread allocations across multiple chunks</b>.</td>
 *     <td>Always uses the current active chunk. Only switches when <b>full</b>.</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Chunk reclamation</td>
 *     <td>A chunk is freed only when it is in {@code q000} and usage drops to 0%. But
 *         cross-size-class subpage pinning often prevents any single chunk from reaching 0%.
 *         The first chunk per arena (in {@code qInit}) is <b>never freed</b>.</td>
 *     <td>When all sub-allocations in a chunk are released ({@code subAllocCount} reaches 0),
 *         the chunk is <b>immediately recycled</b> to the free-list.</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Thread-local caching</td>
 *     <td>{@code PoolThreadCache} holds released buffers in thread-local caches, delaying their
 *         return to the chunk. Cache is trimmed only every 8192 allocations or on thread exit,
 *         making chunk usage appear higher than actual.</td>
 *     <td>No thread-local caching. Release decrements {@code subAllocCount} immediately.</td>
 *   </tr>
 *   <tr>
 *     <td>Typical result for 1000-column decompression</td>
 *     <td>3000 buffers spread across 2-5 chunks. After batch release, chunks remain partially
 *         used due to subpage pinning + thread cache. <b>Memory grows over successive batches
 *         &rarr; OOM.</b></td>
 *     <td>3000 buffers land in 1-2 chunks. After batch release, all chunks immediately
 *         recyclable. <b>Stable memory footprint across batches.</b></td>
 *   </tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <h3>How it works</h3>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Allocates large chunks (default 4MB) from native memory via {@code Unsafe}.
 *   <li>For each small allocation request, bumps a pointer within the current active chunk.
 *   <li>Only switches to a new chunk when the current one has no room.
 *   <li>Reference-counts each chunk: when all sub-allocations are released, the chunk is recycled
 *       into a free-list for reuse instead of being freed to the OS.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Batch-friendly lifecycle</h3>
 *
 * <pre>
 *   Batch N:  allocator.buffer() x 3000  &rarr;  all land in chunk A (bump pointer)
 *             process batch...
 *             release all buffers          &rarr;  subAllocCount = 0 &rarr; chunk A recycled
 *
 *   Batch N+1: allocator.buffer() x 3000  &rarr;  reuse chunk A (zero malloc/free)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * BufferAllocator allocator = new RootAllocator(
 *         BaseAllocator.configBuilder()
 *                 .allocationManagerFactory(new ChunkedAllocationManager.ChunkedFactory())
 *                 .build());
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>For allocations >= chunkSize, a dedicated memory region is allocated directly (no bump
 * pointer), behaving identically to {@code UnsafeAllocationManager}.

         * <h4>Why not always call {@code onChunkDrained}?</h4>
         *
         * <p>Unconditionally calling {@link ChunkedFactory#onChunkDrained} on every release would
         * be thread-safe (the method is {@code synchronized}), but prohibitively expensive: in a
         * high-column scenario (e.g., 1000 columns x 3 buffers = 3000 releases per batch), every
         * release would contend for the factory lock even though only the very last one actually
         * needs to recycle the chunk.
         *
         * <p>To avoid this, we first perform a lock-free check: {@code
         * subAllocCount.decrementAndGet() == 0}, and only enter the synchronized {@code
         * onChunkDrained} when the chunk is truly empty. This reduces lock contention from O(N) to
         * O(1) per drain cycle.
         *
         * <h4>ABA double-recycle problem</h4>
         *
         * <p>However, the gap between {@code subAllocCount.decrementAndGet() == 0} and the
         * subsequent {@code onChunkDrained} call is <b>not atomic</b>. During this window another
         * thread can complete a full allocate-release cycle on the same chunk, triggering a second
         * legitimate drain. Without protection, both callers would enter {@code onChunkDrained} and
         * recycle the same chunk twice (duplicate free-list entry or use-after-free).
         *
         * <p>The {@link Chunk#drainGeneration} snapshot solves this: we capture the generation
         * <i>before</i> the atomic decrement. Inside {@code onChunkDrained}, the generation is
         * compared and incremented atomically under the lock, so only the first caller succeeds;
         * the stale caller sees a mismatch and is skipped.
